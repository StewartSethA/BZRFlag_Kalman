# This agent is stationary (cannot move) but can change its angle to track and shoot at enemy tanks.
# It implements a Kalman Filter to track and predict the movements of other tanks
# And also creates plots (via either GNUPlot or OpenGL) of the probability distributions in order to visualize the efficacy of the Kalman Filter.
